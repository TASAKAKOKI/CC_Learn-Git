git branch
    Up to this point, you’ve worked in a single Git branch called <<master>>. ""Git allows us to create branches"" to experiment with versions of a project. Imagine you want to create version of a story with a happy ending. You can create a new branch and make the happy ending changes to that branch only. It will have no effect on the master branch until you’re ready to merge the happy ending to the master branch.

    In this lesson, we’ll be using Git branching to develop multiple versions of a resumé.

    You can use the command below to answer the question: “which branch am I on?”
        git branch

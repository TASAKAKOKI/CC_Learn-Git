commit on a new branch
    Congratulations! You have switched to a new branch. All the commands you do on master, you can also do on this branch.

    For example, to add files to the staging area, use:
        git add filename
    
    And to commit, use:
        git commit -m "Commit message"
    
    In a moment, you will make a commit on the fencing branch. On the far right, the diagram shows what will happen to the Git project.

Instructions
    1.
    Print the Git commit log.

    Notice the output:
        The commits you see were all made in the master branch. fencing inherited them.
        This means that every commit master has, fencing also has.

    Note: if you find that your cursor is stuck in Git log, press q to escape.

    2.
    In resume.txt, replace your skill at scheming against Hook with your experience in sword-fights.

    Delete this line:
        -Scheme against Captain Hook
    
    and type this line in its place:
        -Engage in swordfights with pirates
    
    3.
    Add resume.txt into the staging area.

    4.
    Commit the changes to the repository with a commit message.

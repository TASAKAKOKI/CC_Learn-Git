git fetch
    After you cloned science-quizzes, you had to run off to teach a class. Now that you’re back at your computer, there’s a problem: what if, while you were teaching, Sally changed the science-quizzes Git project in some way. If so, your clone will no longer be up-to-date.

    An easy way to see if changes have been made to the remote and bring the changes down to your local copy is with:
        <<git fetch>>
    
    This command ""will not merge changes from the remote into your local repository"". It ""brings those changes onto what’s called a remote branch"". Learn more about how this works below.

Instructions
    1.
    Enter this command:
        cd my-quizzes
    
    to go into the my-quizzes directory.

    2.
    Fetch any new changes Sally may have made to the remote.

git commit
    A commit is the last step in our Git workflow. A commit permanently stores changes from the staging area inside the repository.

    git commit is the command we’ll do next. However, one more bit of code is needed for a commit: the option -m followed by a message. Here’s an example
        git commit -m "Complete first line of dialogue"
    
    Standard Conventions for Commit Messages:
        " Must be in quotation marks
        " Written in the present tense
        " Should be brief (50 characters or less) when using -m
        
Instructions
    1.
    Make your first commit! From the terminal, type the command along with a commit message. The message should describe the point of the commit.

    If you’re having trouble thinking of a good commit message, reflect on how the project has changed since it began.

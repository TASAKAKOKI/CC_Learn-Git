git reset review
    To better understand git reset commit_SHA, notice the diagram on the right. Each circle represents a commit.(https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-git/lessons/git-backtracking/exercises/reset-review)
 
    Before reset:
        HEAD is at the most recent commit
    
    After resetting:
        HEAD goes to a previously made commit of your choice
        The gray commits are no longer part of your project
        You have in essence rewound the projectâ€™s history

git add
    In order for Git to start tracking scene-1.txt, the file needs to be added to the staging area.

    We can add a file to the staging area with:
        git add filename
    
    The word filename here refers to the name of the file you are editing, such as scene-1.txt.

Instructions
    1.
    Add scene-1.txt to the staging area in Git. Recall that you will need to identify the file by its name.

    2.
    Check the status of the project in Git.

    In the output, notice that Git indicates the changes to be committed with “new file: scene-1.txt” in green text. Here Git tells us the file was added to the staging area.
